# Connect Lab - Backend
I was challenged by Tech Lab to Prototype a solution for any issue that i've had in my academic life.
So, I prototyped an APP that connects Students who doesn't have computer, with Colleges who has Computers Labs that aren't being used all the time. Therefore, the Colleges who are willing to help, can register the time and quantity of vacancies are available.
